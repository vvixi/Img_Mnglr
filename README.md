# Img_Mnglr
Python program for creating glitch art from images from Bitmaps.

Includes seven algorithms for mangling your .bmp images. 
Mileage will vary depending on your starting image.
Some distortion types will hardly affect one bmp, and mangle others.

# Usage
mnglr -f input_image distortion_type
distortion types: slitscramble, stretch, stripper, stutter, shredder, ribbons, testing

`python mnglr.py -f face.bmp testing`

See included images for examples.

TODO:
* add more algorithms
* add png support?
* add gui?
