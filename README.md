# Img_Mnglr
Python program for creating glitch art from images from Bitmaps.

Includes several simple glitch types for mangling your .bmp images. 
Mileage will vary depending on your starting image.
Some distortion types will hardly affect one bmp, and mangle others.

# Usage
mnglr -f input_image distortion_type

distortion types: slitscramble, stretch, stripper, stutter, shredder, ribbons, confetti, confetti2, testing

`python mnglr.py -f face.bmp testing`
